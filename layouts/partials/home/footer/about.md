Suburmakmur was founded in 1992 by Radjis Gopal, and has more than 25 years of experience in smoking fish.
Before refrigerators, the practice of smoking fish has been done as a preservative.
Nowadays, smoking fish still thrives, because people still want to enjoy the unique smoky flavor that's been imparted into the fish.
Fish that are not stored properly run the risk of having microbial contanimation and the presence of alfatoxins.
Intense smoking procedure have high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
The fish we use are all caught in the wild and are healthy and suffer little to no industrial contanimation.
