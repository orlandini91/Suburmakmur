Throughout history, people have been preserving their food by curing it through a process called smoking.
Doing so would increases the solute concentration in the food and decrease its water potential, which slows down the microbe growth that causes food spoilage.
Although fish can now be preserved by refrigeration and freezing, the smoking of fish is generally done for the unique taste and flavor imparted by the smoking process, which many people crave for.
Having more than 25 years of experience in smoking fish, Suburmakmur continues to delivers these smoky flavored delicacies using fish from the tropical rivers of South America caught by local fishermen.
