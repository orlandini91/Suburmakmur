The fish are caught in Suriname, a country in the north eastern coast of South America.
The country has very little industrial pollution, so different species of fish thrive in its near pristine waters.
Every day, fishermen set sail on one of the Country's largest river called the Suriname river, which flows from the jungles in the tropical rainforest to the Atlantic Ocean. 
The fish we use are all wild fish. Unlike their farmed counterparts, wild fish have more than enough room to move around as they please, and develop muscles, which affects the texture and taste.
Wild fish are also usually healthier and less contaminated than farmed fish.
These factors play an important role to ensure fish that have a wild flavor and are highly nutritious.
