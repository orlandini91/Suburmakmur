The traditional way of smoking fish involves the fish being suspended in a smokehouse over smouldering wood, and left overnight to infuse with the smoke.
Hot smoking involves curing the fish by smoking at a temperature between 70-80 degrees Celsius, which cooks the flesh, and no further cooking is required before consumption.
The fish ends up with a golden brown colour with a dry texture and a unique smoky flavor, that has been enjoyed since ancient times, and is still enjoyed today.
